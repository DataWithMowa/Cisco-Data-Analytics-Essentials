# 📊 Cisco Networking Academy: Data Analytics Essentials Portfolio

This repository hosts my practical projects, labs, and comprehensive analyses completed during the **Cisco Networking Academy's Data Analytics Essentials** course. This self-paced curriculum helped me build a strong foundation in core data analyst tools and techniques, covering the full data lifecycle from acquisition and cleaning to visualization and storytelling.

## 🎯 Key Learning Objectives

The projects within this repository demonstrates my proficiency in three primary software domains critical to data analysis:

1.  **Microsoft Excel:** Applied skills in data cleaning, preparation, transformation, and statistical analysis using advanced functions, pivot tables, and conditional formatting.
2.  **SQL (Structured Query Language):** Expertise in relational database fundamentals, including writing queries to retrieve, filter, join, and aggregate data from multiple tables.
3.  **Tableau (Business Intelligence):** Ability to create impactful data visualizations, interactive dashboards, and compelling data stories that communicate complex findings to stakeholders.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a significant project or set of labs within the course, categorized by the primary tool utilized:

* **`/Excel_Projects/`**: Contains cleaned datasets, analysis spreadsheets, and summary reports showcasing data manipulation techniques.
* **`/SQL_Labs/`**: Holds SQL scripts (e.g., `.sql` files) demonstrating various query types (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY).
* **`/Tableau_Visualizations/`**: Includes exported Tableau workbooks or links to public Tableau dashboards created for final project delivery.

## ✨ Featured Project: \[Project Name Here]

The capstone project for this portfolio involved analyzing **\[Describe the general type of data, e.g., "a public dataset on global energy consumption" or "customer transaction data"].**

* **Challenge:** \[Briefly state the main analytical problem or question.]
* **Process:** Data was first imported and cleaned in Excel to handle missing values and inconsistencies. Key metrics were extracted using complex JOINs and aggregations in SQL.
* **Outcome:** The final results were visualized in Tableau, producing an interactive dashboard that revealed \[Mention a key insight or finding, e.g., "a strong correlation between GDP and renewable energy adoption"].

This portfolio serves as a concrete demonstration of my readiness to turn raw data into actionable business intelligence.
