## Background / Scenario
**Microsoft Excel** is a spreadsheet application developed by Microsoft to run on Windows, Mac OS, Android, and iOS. Excel includes calculation and computation capabilities, as well as tools for creating graphs, charts, and pivot tables.

Microsoft provides a free online version of their Office suite at **Office.com**, which includes Excel. The free version does have some limitations. It does not have the full functionality and features of the paid versions, and it can only be used while connected to the Internet.

> **Note:** There are alternative free spreadsheet applications such as **Google Sheets** and **Apache Calc**. While the steps in this lab were created for the free version of Excel from Office.com, other spreadsheet applications have the same functionalities and similar interfaces and can be used to accomplish this work.

## Part 2: Saving and Opening an Excel Workbook
Saving and opening an Excel workbook uses the same process as with any other Microsoft Office application.

> **Note:** The steps below are specific to the free version of Excel accessible through Office.com. If you are using a paid full version of Excel or other spreadsheet program, the exact steps will vary slightly, but the process is essentially the same.

### Step 1: Saving an Excel Workbook

2. In the Save As options list, select **Save a copy to OneDrive**.
3. In the *My files* dialog box, choose the **Location** where the workbook will be saved. Select the **Documents** directory.
4. In the *Save to OneDrive* window, save the Excel file as **“My_Bicycle_Shop_Sales”**.
    * **Note:** Excel will, by default, save the workbook with an `.xlsx` file extension.
5. Close the Excel workbook.

### Step 2: Opening an Excel Workbook
1. Relaunch Excel from your Office.com account using the method in Part 1 of the lab.
2. To open a saved Excel workbook, select the **File** tab in the top left of the menu bar then select **Open** in the left pane.

## Part 3: Working with Cells, Rows, and Columns

An Excel worksheet is made up of a set of **rows** and **columns**. Rows are identified by **numbers** and columns are identified by **letters**. An Excel worksheet has 16,384 columns and 1,048,576 rows.

The rectangular box at the intersection of a row and column is called a **cell**. Each cell is identified by its column and row coordinates, such as `A1` or `B2`. The coordinates of the active cell are indicated in the **Cell Name Box** above column A. A cell reference is always the column letter followed by the row number.  Values, which include numbers and letters, can be typed into cells. Cells can also contain mathematical formulas and functions for performing calculations.

### Step 1: Changing the Active Cell

1. Click inside cell **A1** at the top left corner of the worksheet. Notice the cell now has a border around it and the cell coordinates are displayed above column A in the **Cell Name Box**.
2. This indicates that cell A1 is the **active cell**. Only one cell is active at a time and data can only be entered into the currently active cell.
3. Now, click into cell **B2**. Note that this cell is now the active cell with a border and its reference coordinates are in the **Cell Name Box** above column A.

***

**What happens if you type the coordinates of a cell directly into the Cell Name Box?**

### ✅ Answer:
> The cell I typed now becomes the **active cell** and has a border around it.

### Step 2: Selecting Columns and Rows
* Click a **column header** (e.g., 'A') to select the entire column. 
* Drag the column divider between two column headers to **resize** the column width.
* Click a **row header** (e.g., '1') to select the entire row.

**Question: How can you select more than one column or row?**

### ✅ Answer:
> Press down the **Ctrl** key and click the column heads or rows you want to select.

### Step 3: Adding Rows and Columns
* Use the **Insert** button in the *Cells* group of the Home tab, then select **Insert Sheet Rows/Columns**.
* **OR** right-click the row or column header, then select **Insert**. 

### Step 4: Selecting a Range of Cells
* **Example:** Click and drag the mouse to select cells `B2` through `C6`.

**Question: What is the result of typing A1:C5 in the Cell Name Box?**

### ✅ Answer:
> Cells **A1 through C5** are highlighted and selected.

### Step 5: Selecting the Entire Sheet
* Click the **triangle** at the top-left corner (above row 1 and to the left of column A).
* **OR** use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+A**.
