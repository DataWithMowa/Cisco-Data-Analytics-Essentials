## Lab Description
In this introductory lab, I gained hands-on experience with the fundamental features of **Microsoft Excel**. This exercise is designed to build my confidence in navigating the spreadsheet environment, from initial data entry to performing automated calculations.

The lab is divided into three key areas of focus:
* **Data Organization:** I learnt how to initialize a worksheet, label headers, and input raw data accurately.
* **Computational Logic:** I transitioned from manual entry to automation by applying custom **formulas** and built-in **functions** (such as `SUM`) to generate business insights like total revenue and profit.
* **File Management:** Finally, I practiced standard formatting techniques to improve readability and learn the proper workflow for saving and exporting my workbook.

By the end of this lab, I have a functional "Sales Data" spreadsheet that demonstrates my ability to transform raw numbers into meaningful financial information.
