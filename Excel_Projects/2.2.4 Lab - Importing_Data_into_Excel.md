* **Part 3:** Importing a Text and CSV file into the Full Version of Excel

## Required Resources
* Mobile device or PC/laptop with an internet connection
* An Office.com account to access the free version of Excel, or the full version of Excel or similar spreadsheet program such as OpenOffice

> **Note:** The precise steps to format and manipulate data in Excel can vary between platforms and versions. The instructions in this lab are based on the free version of Excel available from Office.com and may have to be modified to match the user’s platform, software, or version to achieve the results shown in this lab.

## Instructions

Data is often transmitted in the **CSV**, or comma separated values, format, which is a text-only format readable by many programs. We will discuss CSV files more in Module 3, but here we will look at the basic process of using one to ingest data into Excel.
